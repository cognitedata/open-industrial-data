# [Open Industrial Data](https://openindustrialdata.com/)

>A live stream of industrial data, continuously available and free of charge. Removing the obstacle of data gathering for students, startups & researchers. 
Take it and learn with it. Show us what you find. 
We’re excited to see what's possible.

# You asked for real data?

![Valhall field](https://www.akerbp.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/1455710061745.jpg)

Open industrial data originates from a single compressor on Aker BP’s Valhall oil platform in the North Sea. Aker BP selected the first stage compressor on the Valhall because it is a subsystem with clearly defined boundaries, rich in time series and maintenance data. 

The data set available in the Cognite Data Platform includes time series data, maintenance history, and Process & Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs) for Valhall’s first stage compressor and associated process equipment: first stage suction cooler, first stage suction scrubber, first stage compressor and first stage discharge coolers. In addition, data from the compressor’s lubrication system, dry gas seal system and condition monitoring system (temperature and vibration) will be available.

# [Cognite Workshop](workshop)
*Events and training sessions to build on the open industrial data ecosystem.*

* Get to know the ins- and outs of the CDP SDK and other ways to access data stored in Cognite data platform.
* Dive into open industrial data, exploring an equipment in the first stage compressor train on the Valhall platform.

# [Contributions](contributions)
A collection of interesting analyses by students, civil data scientists, customers, partners and finally Cogniters.
