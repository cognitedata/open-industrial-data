    "Part 4b is an open ended investigation into Industrial data. Cogniters will be around to guide you along, and help you turn your industrial ideas into quality analysis. Here are a few projects to get you started:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data quality investigation\n",
    "Sometimes the edge goes down. We need to know how complete our datasets are. Play with `client.datapoints.get_datapoints_frame` to get years worth of day resolution data and come up with a good way of visualizing gaps in critical sensors. Can you spot times when the platform was shut down?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Graph analytics\n",
    "Use the `networkx` python package (`networkx.from_pandas_dataframe`) to draw some cool visualizations of the asset hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Supervised sensor prediction\n",
    "Use scikit-learn regressors to build a model that uses other sensors to predict the value of one (important) sensor. Think about how this could be extended towards anomaly detection, and the potential pitfalls! A good understanding of the process will help!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unsupervised anomaly detection\n",
    "Build an unsupervised anomaly detection model (Isolation Forest, k-means, pca, to name a few). Conceive an anomaly detection score.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tips\n",
    "- A concise, coherent analysis is more useful than a lengthy notebook that does many shiny things but doesn't reach any conclusions\n",
    "- Ask questions about the assets or read up on them ([ABB's handbook on Oil & Gas](https://library.e.abb.com/public/34d5b70e18f7d6c8c1257be500438ac3/Oil%20and%20gas%20production%20handbook%20ed3x0_web.pdf)).\n",
    "- Work together and share your results\n",
    "- Send us your notebook by opening a pull request to the [contributions folder](https://github.com/cognitedata/open-industrial-data/tree/master/contributions)! A well structured, clear analysis on your github profile and shared with the Open Industrial Data community could be your foot in the door to your next dream job in Data Science!"
